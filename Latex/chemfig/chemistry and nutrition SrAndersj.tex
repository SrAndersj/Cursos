\begin{document}
\subsection{	Phenylalanine }
	is one of nine essential amino
	acids, meaning that it cannot
	be made by the body and must
	come from the diet. A small
	percentage of the population
	has a genetic disorder called
	phenylketonuria, whereby they
	lack the enzyme phenylalanine
	hydroxylase and cannot
	metabolize phenylalanine. The
	artificial sweetener aspartame
	is a source of phenylalanine,
	which is highlighted in many
	food and drink labels.
