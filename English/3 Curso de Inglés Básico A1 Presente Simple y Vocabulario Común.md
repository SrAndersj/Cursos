# Verb to be 

this is one of the most important topics in English and my job is to make sure you understand it very mvery very well.

Something super important to remember here is that the simple present has two options.

One option when you use the famous verb "to be" and the second option when you use different actions.

the verb "to be " will be the first topic in this class 

we will see how use it, when to use it , and we will practice with different examples 

Now what is simple present ense with the verb "to be "

you maybe  ask yourself these questions many times 


the simple present with the verb "to be " is useful when you want to say charactirestics of people 

Do you remember my personal presentation?

i am from colombia . i am 27 years old 

i am using " am" as the verb "to be" because  i am saying characteristics of me 

We also use the verb "to be " to talk about the status or to give details about person , including emotions and characteristics.Go  to the research section of this class and download a document with extra vocabulary that will be very important to express characteristics


Now the  verb "to be "is not like that. you don't see "to be " in the sentences very often 

instead, we normally see "am" "is" or "are" when you are using it in the simple present tense

We can also make diferent adaptations and transformatios and make sentence  in affirmative and negative or in question


in this class , we will practice all those different forms 


let's start with some examples.Look at the baby

i am happy . imagine i am the baby. i am happy . this is an affirmation 

in a negative form , yo can say 

i am not happy 

in a question , we change the position " i am " we changed the order 
and we say

am i happy?
 

i asked a question to myself 

and you respond that question 

yes john yes , you are or
no john  you aren't 


Happy is an emotion .Remember to check the list of vocabulary 

so you can see other adjectives , other emotions and other characteristics 

i am  it's me . let's continue .Look at this lady 

look at her . she is beautiful .


this is an affirmation . let's now check a negative  statement 

she isn't beautiful .what about a question? we changed the position of the elemtnets


we say : is she beautiful ? Remember the intonation 

and we  respond yes , she is or no , she isn't

you can also respond in a full answer . yes she is beautiful or no , she isn't beautiful 

Let's continue look at the man 

he is an important person 

he isn't an important person 

hor he is not important person

is he an important person?


Let's continue look at that hamburger . 

it is delicious 

"it " when we talk about objects , animals , things 


it isn't delicious 

is it delicius ? 


you are strong 

you aren't very strong 

are you a strong person ?


we are friendly 

we aren't friendly

are we friendly?


they are excited they are super happy 

they aren't excited 

are they excited?

# simple present with other verbs 


Simple present with other verbs. In our previous class we practiced simple present with 
verb "to be "  this time we will practice the other option 

Remember we have two separeted elements Verb "to be" or other verbs in the future , you will see  how to make a combination of these two elements 


but for now remember they are separated


let's see what is that other verbs are essentially any action that is not the verb "to bew  "

go , play , visit , travel, cook 

we need to use " do  " and "does " when we use other verbs in order to make the negative  statements and the questions 

in the affirmations there is somthing also very special 

let's give a look at that .Let's check these sentences 

i want you to practice the pronunciatio after me 

number one  

i play soccer

she plays soccer 

you listen to music

she/he listens to music 

we watch tv
she watches tv 


the study english
she/he studies english 


can you see the diffference between the to groups of sentences?

the difference is that when we use  , he/she/it 

we need to add an extra letter or an extra group o letters

ffor example: play /plays   watch /watches   study/ studies 


these transformations are very important and they happen in affirmative sentences only 

go to the resource  section and download an extra document with the rules that you need to follow when you add the s, the "ES" or the "IES" to the actions 


this is called third person "HE","SHE" ans "it"

they have these special variations in 

# Reading and writing exercise : describing people

# WH Questions in simple present 

Welcome to a new module.i'm very excited to be here with you and i have some surprises for you to practice in this class. Let's find it out

"WH"  questions in simple present. in previous classes ,


we practiced "yes" and "no " questions . simple questions that you answer with a yes or a no,  for example, doy like pizza? yes or no? are you from Colombia ?

in this class we will partice information questions and for this i have some special vocabulary  let's check it out 

- who?          [1]
- where?        [2]
- when ?        [3]
- what ?        [4]
- why ?         [5]
- which ?       [6]

these words are used for asking informtaion questions . your job  in this activity is to connect these elements in the corresponding form. i will gie you a moment . you can pause this video and connect the question words with corresponding uses 


let's now  check your answers
"Who " is the question that we ask for people . , very well 

people, for example : Who is that person in the window ?

- Things        [4] 
- Reasons       [5] 
- Options       [6]
- Times         [3] 
- Peole         [1]
- Places            [2]      



"where" is a question that we use for places . for example: where is the supermarket?
"when" that we use it for times . For example: when is your class? oh , my class is tomorrow 
"what" is a very unique question word because we can use it for things, or you can use it also for many other things. you can say : what is your phone number ? it's a thing , right?

but you can also make combinations and you can say : what time is you class? 
it's another question for time 

or you can make open questions like : what's  your name?

"what" is a very common question word in English 

"Why" it's a question about reasons. why do you do that ? , that's not okay , why?  i want to Know the reason. and finally , 

"Which" for "which" we use options , for wxample : Which is your favorite color ? blue or black?


that's different when i say what's your favorite color ?  the question is very open , very general

when i use " Which" i have options. 

the best way to master this topic is with practice. so i want you to do a couple of exercises and for instance i will use "where"

i want you to practice making a questions using each of the question words and also making questions with the verb "to be " and with other verbs 


- practice 

- Where is the car?         where do you live?  


check my example . where. for number onw : where is the car?  "is" i 'm using verb "to be "

second  question  , where do you live? it's another question but this time with another verb

do the same activity with all the other question word 

"when", "why ", "which " so you can practice  Remember to write your  answers in your workbook

 the cat is in the box . Now in this sentence i put a preposition of place 

 can you see the preposition of place? take a moment 

 the preposition of place is "in " because it gives me information about the location of 
 the beautiful cat "is in the box" because i can close the box and now is in the box 

 let's give a look at one more example . that coffe looks delicious 

 Where is  the cup of coffe?
 

 the cup o coffie is on the table . 
 what is the preposition in this sentence?

 the preposition is "on" , "on " is another prepositon that we normally use for horizontal
 , vertical or surface in general 

  the cup of coffe is on the table , is a surface 

  or for instance , my pictures , my paintings are on the wall 
  it's a vertical surface. there are more uses for "on" but these are the most common

  where is she? 

  take a moment and give me your answer 

  she is in front of the laptop . again , tell me what is the preposition of place here?

  and the answer is "in ront of"

  and let's check one more . Look at the kids, where are they? 

take a moment and tell me your answer

they are next to the christmas tree

what's the preposition in this sentence?

or i am next to my microphone. "Next to"  there are more prepositions in English and we can continue talking about this for hours, but these are the most common ones that we will practice this time , 

"Beside" is an example of another form to say " next to"  i am next to the window . i am beside the window 

"Behind" is the opposite o in "in front" for instnce , i am in front of my computer , or the books or the picture are behind me
