# Verb to be 

this is one of the most important topics in English and my job is to make sure you understand it very mvery very well.

Something super important to remember here is that the simple present has two options.

One option when you use the famous verb "to be" and the second option when you use different actions.

the verb "to be " will be the first topic in this class 

we will see how use it, when to use it , and we will practice with different examples 

Now what is simple present ense with the verb "to be "

you maybe  ask yourself these questions many times 


the simple present with the verb "to be " is useful when you want to say charactirestics of people 

Do you remember my personal presentation?

i am from colombia . i am 27 years old 

i am using " am" as the verb "to be" because  i am saying characteristics of me 

We also use the verb "to be " to talk about the status or to give details about person , including emotions and characteristics.Go  to the research section of this class and download a document with extra vocabulary that will be very important to express characteristics


Now the  verb "to be "is not like that. you don't see "to be " in the sentences very often 

instead, we normally see "am" "is" or "are" when you are using it in the simple present tense

We can also make diferent adaptations and transformatios and make sentence  in affirmative and negative or in question


in this class , we will practice all those different forms 


let's start with some examples.Look at the baby

i am happy . imagine i am the baby. i am happy . this is an affirmation 

in a negative form , yo can say 

i am not happy 

in a question , we change the position " i am " we changed the order 
and we say

am i happy?
 

i asked a question to myself 

and you respond that question 

yes john yes , you are or
no john  you aren't 


Happy is an emotion .Remember to check the list of vocabulary 

so you can see other adjectives , other emotions and other characteristics 

i am  it's me . let's continue .Look at this lady 

look at her . she is beautiful .


this is an affirmation . let's now check a negative  statement 

she isn't beautiful .what about a question? we changed the position of the elemtnets


we say : is she beautiful ? Remember the intonation 

and we  respond yes , she is or no , she isn't

you can also respond in a full answer . yes she is beautiful or no , she isn't beautiful 

Let's continue look at the man 

he is an important person 

he isn't an important person 

hor he is not important person

is he an important person?


Let's continue look at that hamburger . 

it is delicious 

"it " when we talk about objects , animals , things 


it isn't delicious 

is it delicius ? 


you are strong 

you aren't very strong 

are you a strong person ?


we are friendly 

we aren't friendly

are we friendly?


they are excited they are super happy 

they aren't excited 

are they excited?
