### Acocounting 

- A system of recording financial transactions with both numbers and text in the form of financial  statements 


- Billing clients , keeping track of assets  and liabilities , determine profitability , and tracking the flow of cash 

these are the core principles of accounting and finance , when you  understand these core principles then  you have better understanding  of complex concepts such as corporate finance , investment , audits  and etcetera 

 
 so what is accounting?


A system of recording financial transactions with both numbers and text in the form of financial  statements.

The accuracy with which financial statements are recorded cannot be highlighted enough 

why is that ? Companies use financial statements to track their cash flow to see if they're billing 

their clients properly  to see their liabilities and equity , and the ratio between the two 


bot of course , to see if  they're making a profit 


now , let's look a little bit closely at these three concepts 

## Assets 

- Cash 
- Accounts receivable 
- inventory
- prepaid expense
- investment
- property
- etc

Assets . What can you expect to see under assets?

well, cash , accounts receivable , property investment and prepaid expense 

prepaid expense bring financial or economic benefit to a company

an example of that  would be  prepaid rent .


so let's at what you would expect under liabilities
##  Liabilities 

- Accounts payable 
- notes payable
- accrued expenses
- deferred revenue
- etc
