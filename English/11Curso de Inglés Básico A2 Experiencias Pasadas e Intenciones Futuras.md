# personal experiences in the past

 welcome to the first class of the first module . 

 i'm very excited because this time we're going to learn how to talk about personal experiences in the past 


 this class and the next one are heavily grammar oriented ,so it's very important that you bring your coffee , your water , your notebook and you make sure you take some notes because you're gonna need them

 to start with , we need to understand a little bit how the tense or the particular grammar structure that we need for this intention works  

 so let's take a look at this structure that we use for the present perfect tense 


 - subject + have/has +verb in the past participle +complement 
 - Mary       has visited      her parents recently 

 i want to give you first an example and then we're going to analyze it together 

 "Mary       has visited      her parents recently "   i intentionally highlighted two words in this sntence because we're going to need them 'has' and  'visited'

 Now the full structure of this sentence is composed by several things


 the first is the subject , which in this case is Mary 

 Now , as a second element i have the word 'has ', remember because Mary refers to the personal pronoun  'she '  we  have to use 'has ' in this case. Right after we have the verb in past participle form  

 but don't worry , we'll get there in just a second and then finally we have the complement of that sentence. so in the end i have 'Mary has visited her parents recently ' and the final composition would be ; subject 'have' or 'has' depending on the personal pronoun , then the action in the past participle form and the compliment 

 i Know this sound like a lot of information but don't worry 

 i'm gonna break this down into little pieces    so we can analyze it little by little
